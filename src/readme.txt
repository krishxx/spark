Spark itself is written in Scala, and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
To run Spark on either your laptop or a cluster, all you need is an installation of Java 6 or
newer. If you wish to use the Python API you will also need a Python interpreter
(version 2.6 or newer). Spark does not yet work with Python 3.
